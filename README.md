## Overview

This project was challenging for me. But I've tried to do my best.

I structured the site into divs. One for the header (upper section), the other for main (profile pics and description), and just one more for the footer. 

For the header, I use flex-box utilities because I want to practice my flex-box knowledge.

Maybe with position: relative-absolute mix it could work, but when you try to make it responsive it's easy with flex-box and just one-line code.

For the main section, I stylish with a grid system. It's a better option for me to arrange photos in a "grid".

Finally, for the footer, I've just copy 'recycle the last code that I've used for the 404 not found page.

Thanks for reading, hope you enjoy the solution and give me feedback.
